## Interoperability Framework FGM RIS Spine Mini Service – Client Requirements ##

 The [IF FGM RIS Spine Mini Service – Client Requirements] document is a specification for the implementation of services that are expected to be provided by Spine Mini Service Clients. This document also contains requirements for the design and assurance process. The implementation specification provides some requirements for some non-functional behaviour of the SMS as well as some guidance for implementation decisions.

The requirements in this document will be assured using the Interoperability Framework Accreditation process for Spine Mini Services.



## Interoperability Framework Spine Mini Service – FGM RIS Provider Requirements ##

The [IF FGM RIS Spine Mini Service – Provider Requirements] document is a specification for the implementation of services that are expected to be provided by a Spine Mini Service Provider (SMSP). There are also requirements in here for the design and assurance process. The implementation specification provides some requirements for some non-functional behaviour of the SMSP as well as some guidance for implementation decisions.

Some of the requirements in this document will be assured using the Common Assurance Process and some will be assured using the Interoperability Framework Accreditation process..
