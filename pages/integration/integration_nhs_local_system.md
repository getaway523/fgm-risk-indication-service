# FGM RIS Local System Integration Requirements #

The [Local System Integration Requirements] document provides NHS funded healthcare providers in England and their NHS IT systems suppliers with a clear description of the interoperability and functional requirements to access the Spine FGM RIS Service from local NHS IT systems to. These requirements supersede those requirements specified in the FGM RIS Local System Integration Information Standard (SCCI2112) for view capability.

# FGM RIS Requirements Specification Guidance #

The [FGM RIS Requirements Specification Guidance] document provides guidance on key messages and wording that should be considered when developing the FGM risk indicator message within local systems, to provide a level of consistency when referring to the FGM RIS and user display messages.

This document should be read in conjunction with the FGM RIS Local System Integration Requirements Specification.
