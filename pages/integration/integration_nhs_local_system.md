# FGM RIS Local System Integration Requirements #

The [Local System Integration Requirements] document provides NHS funded healthcare providers in England and their NHS IT systems suppliers with a clear description of the interoperability and functional requirements to access the Spine FGM RIS Service from local NHS IT systems to. These requirements supersede those requirements specified in the FGM RIS Local System Integration Information Standard (SCCI2112) for view capability.
