# The FGM Vision #

The FGM Risk Indication System provides the ability to identify (flag) and share an identifier of vulnerable girls and women at risk of FGM (Female Genital Mutilation).

The FGM Risk Indication Service supports the wider Female Genital Mutilation Prevention (FGMP) Programme which is in place to protect, prevent and care for girls and vulnerable women who are at risk of FGM or who have been subjected to it. This service will allow Healthcare professionals and other government organisations (with an appropriate relationship), to flag girls and vulnerable women who are at risk of FGM. This information will be available in the following settings: Spine 2, GP systems, Child Health Systems and other government agencies.
